          For an organisation to be sustainable and create value, it needs to go
          beyond Product Market Fit & Revenue Growth and build a system that
          Bridges Revenue Growth with Profitability, Capital Efficiency & Free
          Cash Flow. To enable this, the finance function needs to go beyond
          merely accounting & reporting, and take leadership in designing an
          enterprise performance management framework, for financial value
          creation & preservation. The building blocks typically include:

            The old adage goes that you never get a second chance to make the
            first impression. It is a well-established fact that companies that

            Reliability of processes for capturing, recoding, validating &

            Charlie Munger had infamously dismissed EBITDA as an unreliable
            metric. The reason being, high EBITDA is no assurance of value
            creation, as capital can be blocked in Receivables and Inventory.
            Poor Working Capital management chokes up growth, as businesses
            require additional working capital, but also dilute Enterprise
            Value. For example an additional 15 Days of Working Capital blocked
            in Receivables can dilute PBT Margins by 0.75 - 1%. At a typical 15
            - 18% PBT across most industries, this means a dilution in
            Enterprise Valuation by 5-7.5%. So moving your DSO from 75 days to
            60 Days cana potentially impact valuation by 5%. Augmenting human
            effort with the right data architecture & technology, ovrlayed with

            A growth stagae business is simply a race against time of converting
            capital raised into free cash before running out of capital.
            However, our experience suggests that mst of growth stage companines
            under invest in aa formal capital allocation prcess. This is
            typically because while most management teams have strong domain
            knowledge, they are new to capital allocation themselves and
            customer outreach and sales take preceedence over setting up a
            formala capital allocation process is both scientific and eliminates
